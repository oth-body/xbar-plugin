## What are these?

These are Xbar plugins that I've made that I hope others find useful.


## How to use them

  * Just drop the plugin into your xbar plugins folder (if you have the repo, why not use the `Enabled` folder?)
  * Make sure it's executable (in Terminal, do `chmod +x plugin.sh`)
  * Then choose `Refresh all` from the xbar menus
